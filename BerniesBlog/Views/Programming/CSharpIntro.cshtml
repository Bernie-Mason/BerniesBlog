<h2>Introduction to C#</h2>

<p><strong>Microsoft Visual C#</strong> is a programming language primarily used for building and developing a variety of applications using the .NET Framework. It is a multi-paradigm (multi-style) programming language that allows programmers to use the most suitable programming style and language elements for a given job. It's paradigms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="CSharp/ObjectOriented">Object-oriented:</a></strong> Based on the concept of objects. Such objects may contain data, as fields (attributes) and functions (methods).</li>
    <li><strong>Functional:</strong> Treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Strongly-typed:</strong> Much more likely than a weakly-typed language to produce an error or refuse toi compile if the argument passed to a function doesn't match the expected type.</li>
    <li><strong>Imperative:</strong> Using statements to change a programs state</li>
    <li><strong>Declarative:</strong> Expressing the computation logic without expressing the order in which statements or functions are executed (control flow).</li>
    <li><strong>Generic:</strong> The types of algorithms can be declared but remain uninstantiated until they are need to be instantiated</li>
</ul>
